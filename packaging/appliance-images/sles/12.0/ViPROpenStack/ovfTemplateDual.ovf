Agreement, the Product Notice, and payment of all license fees, EMC grants to&#13;
Customer a nonexclusive and nontransferable (except as otherwise permitted&#13;
herein) license (with no right to sublicense) to use (i) Software for Customer's&#13;
internal business purposes; and (ii) the Documentation related to Software for&#13;
the purpose of supporting Customer's use of Software. Licenses granted to&#13;
Customer shall, unless otherwise indicated on the Product Notice or quote from&#13;
EMC or Distributor) be perpetual and commence on Delivery of the physical media&#13;
or the date Customer is notified of electronic availability, as applicable.&#13;
Documentation is licensed solely for purposes of supporting Customer's use of&#13;
Software as permitted in this Section. To the extent applicable to Software,&#13;
Customer may be required to follow EMC's then current product registration&#13;
process, if any, to obtain and input an authorization key or license file.&#13;
B.  Licensing Models.  Software is licensed for use only in accordance with the&#13;
commercial terms and restrictions of the Software's relevant licensing model,&#13;
which are stated in the Product Notice and/or quote from EMC or Distributor. For&#13;
example, the licensing model may provide that Software is licensed for use&#13;
solely (i) for a certain number of licensing units; (ii) on or in connection&#13;
with certain hardware, or a CPU, network or other hardware environment; and/or&#13;
(iii) for a specified amount of storage capacity. Microcode, firmware or&#13;
operating system software required to enable the hardware with which it is&#13;
shipped to perform its basic functions, is licensed for use solely on such&#13;
hardware.&#13;
C.  License Restrictions.  All Software licenses granted herein are for use of&#13;
object code only. Customer is permitted to copy Software as necessary to install&#13;
and run it in accordance with the license, but otherwise for back-up purposes&#13;
only. Customer may copy Documentation insofar as reasonably necessary in&#13;
connection with Customer's authorized internal use of Software. Customer shall&#13;
not, without EMC's prior written consent (i) use Software in a service bureau,&#13;
application service provider or similar capacity; or (ii) disclose to any third&#13;
party the results of any comparative or competitive analyses, benchmark testing&#13;
or analyses of Software performed by or on behalf of Customer; (iii) make&#13;
available Software in any form to anyone other than Customer's employees or&#13;
contractors; or (iv) transfer Software to an Affiliate or a third party.&#13;
D.  Software Releases.  Software Releases shall be subject to the license terms&#13;
applicable to Software.&#13;
E.  Audit Rights.  EMC (including its independent auditors) shall have the right&#13;
to audit Customer's usage of Software to confirm compliance with the agreed&#13;
terms. Such audit is subject to reasonable advance notice by EMC and shall not&#13;
unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities. Customer will&#13;
provide EMC with the support required to perform such audit and will, without&#13;
prejudice to other rights of EMC, address any non-compliant situations&#13;
identified by the audit by forthwith procuring additional licenses.&#13;
F.  Termination.  EMC may terminate licenses for cause, if Customer breaches the&#13;
terms governing use of Software and fails to cure within thirty (30) days after&#13;
receipt of EMC's written notice thereof. Upon termination of a license, Customer&#13;
shall cease all use and return or certify destruction of the applicable Software&#13;
(including copies) to EMC.&#13;
G.  Reserved Rights.  All rights not expressly granted to Customer are reserved.&#13;
In particular, no title to, or ownership of, the Software is transferred to&#13;
Customer. Customer shall reproduce and include copyright and other proprietary&#13;
notices on and in any copies of the Software. Unless expressly permitted by&#13;
applicable mandatory law, Customer shall not modify, enhance, supplement, create&#13;
derivative works from, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, decompile or&#13;
otherwise reduce to human readable form the Software without EMC's prior written&#13;
consent, nor shall Customer permit any third party to do the same.&#13;
&#13;
4.  WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.&#13;
A.  Software Warranty.  EMC warrants that Software will substantially conform to&#13;
the applicable Documentation for such Software and that any physical media&#13;
provided by EMC will be free from manufacturing defects in materials and&#13;
workmanship until the expiration of the warranty period. EMC does not warrant&#13;
that the operation of Software shall be uninterrupted or error free, that all&#13;
defects can be corrected, or that Software meets Customer's requirements, except&#13;
if expressly warranted by EMC in its quote. Support Services from EMC for&#13;
Software are available for separate purchase and the Support Options are&#13;
identified at the Product Notice.&#13;
B.  Warranty Duration.  Unless otherwise stated on the EMC quote, the warranty&#13;
period for Software shall (i) be as set forth at the Product Notice; and (ii)&#13;
commence upon Delivery of the media or the date Customer is notified of&#13;
electronic availability, as applicable.&#13;
C.  Customer Remedies.  EMC's entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedies&#13;
under the warranties described in this section shall be for EMC, at its option,&#13;
to remedy the non-compliance or to replace the affected Software. If EMC is&#13;
unable to effect such within a reasonable time, then EMC shall refund the amount&#13;
received by EMC for the Software concerned. All replaced Software contained on&#13;
physical media supplied by EMC shall be returned to and become the property of&#13;
EMC. EMC shall have no liability hereunder after expiration of the applicable&#13;
warranty period. The foregoing shall not void any supplementary remedies made&#13;
available to Customer by a Distributor, with respect to which EMC shall have no&#13;
liability or obligation.&#13;
D.  Warranty Exclusions.  Warranty does not cover problems that arise from (i)&#13;
accident or neglect by Customer or any third party; (ii) any third party items&#13;
or services with which Software is used or other causes beyond EMC's control;&#13;
(iii) installation, operation or use not in accordance with EMC's instructions&#13;
or the applicable Documentation; (iv) use in an environment, in a manner or for&#13;
a purpose for which Software was not designed; or (v) modification, alteration&#13;
or repair by anyone other than EMC or its authorized representatives;. EMC has&#13;
no obligation whatsoever for Software installed or used beyond the licensed use,&#13;
or whose original identification marks have been altered or removed. Removal or&#13;
disablement of remote support capabilities during the warranty period requires&#13;
reasonable notice to EMC. Such removal or disablement, or improper use or&#13;
failure to use applicable Customer Support Tools shall be subject to a surcharge&#13;
in accordance with EMC's then current standard rates.&#13;
E.  No Further Warranties.  Except for the warranty set forth herein, and to the&#13;
maximum extent permitted by law, EMC (INCLUDING ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKES NO OTHER&#13;
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL. INSOFAR AS PERMITTED UNDER&#13;
APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED, INCLUDING&#13;
WARRANTIES ARISING BY STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.&#13;
&#13;
5.  SUPPORT SERVICES.&#13;
A.  Support Services.  If Customer has purchased Support Services for Software&#13;
(or its related hardware, if any) directly from EMC, such shall be delivered by&#13;
EMC as specified in the applicable Product Notice. If Customer has purchased&#13;
maintenance and support from a Distributor, then EMC may provide Support&#13;
Services to the extent that the Distributor has contracted with EMC to provide&#13;
Customer with Support Services.&#13;
B.  Reinstatement of Lapsed Support.  If Support Services expire or are&#13;
terminated, and Customer subsequently seeks to reinstate Support Services,&#13;
Customer shall pay: (i) the cumulative Support Services fees applicable for the&#13;
period during which Support Services lapsed; (ii) the annual support fees for&#13;
the then-current current period; and (iii) the then-current reinstatement fee&#13;
and/or certification fees, as quoted by EMC or a Distributor.&#13;
C.  Support Tools.  EMC may use Support Tools or may make certain Support Tools&#13;
available to assist Customer in performing various maintenance or support&#13;
related tasks. Customer shall use Support Tools only in accordance with the&#13;
terms under which EMC makes such available.&#13;
D.  Additional Support Terms.  Unless otherwise indicated in the Product Notice,&#13;
Support Services provided by EMC shall consist of (i) using commercially&#13;
reasonable efforts to remedy failures of Software to perform substantially in&#13;
accordance with EMC's applicable Documentation; (ii) providing English-language&#13;
(or where available, local language help line service (via telephone or other&#13;
electronic media); and (iii) providing, or enabling Customer to download&#13;
Software Releases and Documentation updates made generally available by EMC at&#13;
no additional charge to other purchasers of Support Service for the applicable&#13;
Software.&#13;
E.  Software Releases.  Upon use of a Software Release, Customer shall remove&#13;
and make no further use of all prior Software Releases, and protect such prior&#13;
Software Releases from disclosure or use by any third party. Customer is&#13;
authorized to retain a copy of each Software Release properly obtained by&#13;
Customer for Customer's archive purposes and use such as a temporary back-up if&#13;
the current Software Release becomes inoperable. Customer shall use and deploy&#13;
Software Releases strictly in accordance with terms of the original license for&#13;
the Software.&#13;
F.  Support Services for Software affected by Change in Hardware Status.  For&#13;
Software used on or operated in connection with hardware that ceases to be&#13;
covered by Support Services or the EMC hardware warranty, EMC reserves the right&#13;
to send Customer written notice that EMC has either chosen to discontinue or&#13;
change the price for Support Services for such Software (with such price change&#13;
effective as of the date the applicable EMC hardware ceases to be so covered).&#13;
If EMC sends a discontinuation notice, or if Customer rejects or does not&#13;
respond to the notice of a proposed price change within thirty (30) days after&#13;
receipt, Customer will be deemed to have terminated the Support Services for its&#13;
convenience.&#13;
G.  Support Services Exclusions.  Support Services do not cover problems that&#13;
arise from (i) accident or neglect by Customer or any third party; (ii) any&#13;
third party items or services with which the Software is used or other causes&#13;
beyond EMC's control; (iii) installation, operation or use not in accordance&#13;
with EMC's instructions or the applicable Documentation; (iv) use in an&#13;
environment, in a manner or for a purpose for which the Software or its related&#13;
hardware was not designed; or (v) modification, alteration or repair by anyone&#13;
other than EMC or its authorized designees. EMC has no obligation whatsoever for&#13;
Software installed or used beyond the licensed use. Removal or disablement of&#13;
Software's remote support capabilities during the term of Support Services&#13;
requires reasonable notice to EMC. Customer's removal, disablement of remote&#13;
support capabilities, or improper use of or failure to use Support Tools made&#13;
available to Customer shall subject Customer to a surcharge in accordance with&#13;
EMC's then current standard rates.&#13;
&#13;
6.  INDEMNITY.  EMC shall (i) defend Customer against any third party claim that&#13;
Software or Support Services infringes a patent or copyright existing in the&#13;
country in which EMC is located, the United States of America or the European&#13;
Union; and (ii) pay the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against&#13;
Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction or the amounts stated in a written&#13;
settlement negotiated by EMC. The foregoing obligations are subject to the&#13;
following: Customer (a) notifies EMC promptly in writing of such claim; (b)&#13;
grants EMC sole control over the defense and settlement thereof; (c) reasonably&#13;
cooperates in response to an EMC request for assistance; and (d) is not in&#13;
material breach of this Agreement. Should any such Software or Support Service&#13;
become, or in EMC's opinion be likely to become, the subject of such a claim,&#13;
EMC may, at its option and expense, (1) procure for Customer the right to make&#13;
continued use thereof; (2) replace or modify such so that it becomes non-&#13;
infringing; (3) request return of the Software and, upon receipt thereof; refund&#13;
the price paid by Customer, less straight-line depreciation based on a three (3)&#13;
year useful life for Software; or (4) discontinue the Support Service and refund&#13;
the portion of any pre-paid Support Service fee that corresponds to the period&#13;
of Support Service discontinuation. EMC shall have no liability to the extent&#13;
that the alleged infringement arises out of or relates to: (A) the use or&#13;
combination of Software or Support Service with third party products or&#13;
services; (B) use for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software or Support&#13;
Service was not designed; (C) any modification made by any person other than EMC&#13;
or its authorized representatives; (D) any modifications to Software or Support&#13;
Service made by EMC pursuant to Customer's specific instructions; (E) any&#13;
technology owned or licensed by Customer from third parties; or (F) use of any&#13;
older version of the Software when use of a newer Software Release made&#13;
available to Customer would have avoided the infringement. THIS SECTION STATES&#13;
CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND EMC'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR THIRD PARTY&#13;
INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.&#13;
&#13;
7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#13;
A.  Limitation on Direct Damages.  EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS ARISING UNDER&#13;
SECTION 6 ABOVE, EMC'S TOTAL LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY&#13;
FOR ANY CLAIM OF ANY TYPE WHATSOEVER, ARISING OUT OF SOFTWARE OR SERVICE&#13;
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, SHALL BE LIMITED TO PROVEN DIRECT DAMAGES CAUSED BY EMC'S&#13;
SOLE NEGLIGENCE IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED (i) US$1,000,000, FOR DAMAGE TO REAL&#13;
OR TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY; AND (ii) THE PRICE PAID BY CUSTOMER TO EMC FOR&#13;
THE SPECIFIC SERVICE (CALCULATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, WHEN APPLICABLE) OR&#13;
SOFTWARE FROM WHICH SUCH CLAIM ARISES, FOR DAMAGE OF ANY TYPE NOT IDENTIFIED IN&#13;
(i) ABOVE OR OTHERWISE EXCLUDED HEREUNDER.&#13;
B.  No Indirect Damages.  EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS REGARDING VIOLATION OF&#13;
EMC'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR CLAIMS ARISING UNDER SECTION 6 ABOVE,&#13;
NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR EMC SHALL HAVE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL,&#13;
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT&#13;
LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, DATA AND/OR USE), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#13;
POSSIBILITY THEREOF.&#13;
C.  Special Exclusion.  IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR&#13;
EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ALL OR A PORTION OF SECTION&#13;
7.A AND/OR 7.B ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY.&#13;
D.  Regular Back-ups.  As part of its obligation to mitigate damages, Customer&#13;
shall take reasonable data back-up measures. In particular, Customer shall back-&#13;
up the relevant data before EMC performs any remedial, upgrade, new Software&#13;
Release or other works on Customer's production systems. To the extent EMC's&#13;
liability for loss of data is not anyway excluded under this Agreement, EMC&#13;
shall in case of data losses only be liable for the typical effort to recover&#13;
the data which would have accrued if Customer had appropriately backed up its&#13;
data.&#13;
E.  Limitation Period.  Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the&#13;
limitation period for claims for damages shall be eighteen (18) months after the&#13;
cause of action accrues, unless statutory law provides for a shorter limitation&#13;
period.&#13;
F.  Suppliers.  The foregoing limitations shall also apply in favor of EMC's&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
8.  EVALUATION AND LOANED SOFTWARE.&#13;
A.  This Agreement shall also apply to (i) "Evaluation Software" (meaning the&#13;
copy of Software which contains this Agreement, including any copies made by or&#13;
on behalf of Customer, and all Documentation for the foregoing, which are&#13;
licensed for a limited duration for the specific purpose of evaluation prior to&#13;
making a final decision on procurement; and (ii) "Loaned Software" (meaning the&#13;
copy of Software which contains this Agreement, including any copies made by or&#13;
on behalf of Customer, and all Documentation for the foregoing, which are&#13;
licensed for a limited duration directly  to Customer for a limited period of&#13;
time at no charge), subject to the following:&#13;
B.  The particular Evaluation or Loaned Software, period of use, Installation&#13;
Site and other transaction-specific conditions shall be as mutually agreed&#13;
between EMC and Customer and recorded in the form of an evaluation or loan&#13;
schedule.&#13;
C.  Notwithstanding any deviating terms in this Agreement, all licenses for&#13;
Evaluation and Loaned Software expire at the end of the evaluation or loan&#13;
period.&#13;
D.  Customer shall return Evaluation and Loaned Software at the end of the&#13;
evaluation or loan period or when sooner terminated by EMC for convenience by&#13;
giving thirty (30) days' written notice, whichever occurs first. Customer shall&#13;
bear the risk of loss and damage for return of physical media, if any, and de-&#13;
installation.&#13;
E.  Customer may use Evaluation and Loaned Software free of charge, but, in the&#13;
case of Evaluation Software, solely for the purpose of evaluation and not in a&#13;
production environment.&#13;
F.  Without prejudice to any other limitations on EMC's liability set forth in&#13;
this Agreement (which shall also apply to Evaluation and Loaned Software),&#13;
Evaluation and Loaned Software are provided "AS IS" and any warranty or damage&#13;
claims against EMC in connection with Evaluation and Loaned Software are hereby&#13;
excluded, except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct of EMC.&#13;
G.  Unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by EMC, EMC does not provide&#13;
maintenance or support for any Evaluation Software. CUSTOMER RECOGNIZES THAT&#13;
EVALUATION SOFTWARE MAY HAVE DEFECTS OR DEFICIENCIES WHICH CANNOT OR MAY NOT BE&#13;
CORRECTED BY EMC. EMC shall have no liability to Customer for any action (or any&#13;
prior related claims) brought by or against Customer alleging that Customer's&#13;
sale, use or other disposition of any Evaluation Software infringes any patent,&#13;
copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right. In event of such&#13;
an action, EMC retains the right to terminate this Agreement and take possession&#13;
of the Evaluation Software. THIS SECTION STATES EMC'S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH&#13;
RESPECT TO ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY EVALUATION&#13;
SOFTWARE OR ANY PART OF IT OR ITS OPERATION.&#13;
&#13;
9.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each party shall (i) use Confidential Information of the&#13;
other party only for the purposes of exercising rights or performing obligations&#13;
in connection with this Agreement; and (ii) use at least reasonable care to&#13;
protect from disclosure to any third parties any Confidential Information&#13;
disclosed by the other party for a period commencing upon the date of disclosure&#13;
until three (3) years thereafter, except with respect to Customer data to which&#13;
EMC may have access in connection with the provision of Services, which shall&#13;
remain Confidential Information until one of the exceptions stated in the above&#13;
definition of Confidential Information applies. Notwithstanding the foregoing,&#13;
either party may disclose Confidential Information (a) to an Affiliate for the&#13;
purpose of fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights hereunder as long&#13;
as such Affiliate complies with the foregoing; and (b) if required by law&#13;

misrepresentation or otherwise, is limited in respect of each event or a series&#13;

location sufficiently distant to avoid being impacted by the event(s) (e.g.&#13;
including but not limited to flood, fire, power loss, denial of access or air&#13;
crash) and affect the availability of data at the impacted site;&#13;
		  2) have adequate processes and procedures in place to restore&#13;
data back to a point in time and prior to point of failure, and in the event of&#13;
real or perceived data loss, provide the skills/backup and outage windows to&#13;

Unless otherwise agreed, a common carrier shall be specified by EMC. Software&#13;
may be provided by (i) Delivery of physical media; or (ii) electronic means&#13;
(where available from EMC). If the physical media containing Software has not&#13;
been sold (for example - a lease or rental transaction), then risk of loss&#13;
thereto transfers at Delivery, but title does not.&#13;
B.  Installation and Acceptance.  EMC's obligation, if any, to install Software&#13;
as part of the Software's licensing fee, is set forth in the Product Notice.&#13;
Acceptance that Software operates in substantial conformity to the Software's&#13;

Notwithstanding such acceptance, Customer retains all rights and remedies set&#13;
forth in Section 4 (WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER) below.&#13;
&#13;
3.  LICENSE TERMS.&#13;

herein) license (with no right to sublicense) to use (i) Software for Customer's&#13;
internal business purposes; and (ii) the Documentation related to Software for&#13;
the purpose of supporting Customer's use of Software. Licenses granted to&#13;
Customer shall, unless otherwise indicated on the Product Notice or quote from&#13;
EMC or Distributor) be perpetual and commence on Delivery of the physical media&#13;
or the date Customer is notified of electronic availability, as applicable.&#13;
Documentation is licensed solely for purposes of supporting Customer's use of&#13;
Software as permitted in this Section. To the extent applicable to Software,&#13;
Customer may be required to follow EMC's then current product registration&#13;
process, if any, to obtain and input an authorization key or license file.&#13;
B.  Licensing Models.  Software is licensed for use only in accordance with the&#13;
commercial terms and restrictions of the Software's relevant licensing model,&#13;

example, the licensing model may provide that Software is licensed for use&#13;
solely (i) for a certain number of licensing units; (ii) on or in connection&#13;
with certain hardware, or a CPU, network or other hardware environment; and/or&#13;
(iii) for a specified amount of storage capacity. Microcode, firmware or&#13;
operating system software required to enable the hardware with which it is&#13;
shipped to perform its basic functions, is licensed for use solely on such&#13;

C.  License Restrictions.  All Software licenses granted herein are for use of&#13;
object code only. Customer is permitted to copy Software as necessary to install&#13;
and run it in accordance with the license, but otherwise for back-up purposes&#13;
only. Customer may copy Documentation insofar as reasonably necessary in&#13;
connection with Customer's authorized internal use of Software. Customer shall&#13;
not, without EMC's prior written consent (i) use Software in a service bureau,&#13;
application service provider or similar capacity; or (ii) disclose to any third&#13;
party the results of any comparative or competitive analyses, benchmark testing&#13;
or analyses of Software performed by or on behalf of Customer; (iii) make&#13;
available Software in any form to anyone other than Customer's employees or&#13;
contractors; or (iv) transfer Software to an Affiliate or a third party.&#13;

applicable to Software.&#13;
E.  Audit Rights.  EMC (including its independent auditors) shall have the right&#13;
to audit Customer's usage of Software to confirm compliance with the agreed&#13;
terms. Such audit is subject to reasonable advance notice by EMC and shall not&#13;
unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities. Customer will&#13;
provide EMC with the support required to perform such audit and will, without&#13;
prejudice to other rights of EMC, address any non-compliant situations&#13;
identified by the audit by forthwith procuring additional licenses.&#13;
F.  Termination.  EMC may terminate licenses for cause, if Customer breaches the&#13;
terms governing use of Software and fails to cure within thirty (30) days after&#13;
receipt of EMC's written notice thereof. Upon termination of a license, Customer&#13;
shall cease all use and return or certify destruction of the applicable Software&#13;
(including copies) to EMC.&#13;
G.  Reserved Rights.  All rights not expressly granted to Customer are reserved.&#13;
In particular, no title to, or ownership of, the Software is transferred to&#13;

applicable mandatory law, Customer shall not modify, enhance, supplement, create&#13;
derivative works from, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, decompile or&#13;
otherwise reduce to human readable form the Software without EMC's prior written&#13;
consent, nor shall Customer permit any third party to do the same.&#13;
&#13;
4.  WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.&#13;
A.  Software Warranty.  EMC warrants that Software will substantially conform to&#13;
the applicable Documentation for such Software and that any physical media&#13;
provided by EMC will be free from manufacturing defects in materials and&#13;
workmanship until the expiration of the warranty period. EMC does not warrant&#13;
that the operation of Software shall be uninterrupted or error free, that all&#13;
defects can be corrected, or that Software meets Customer's requirements, except&#13;
if expressly warranted by EMC in its quote. Support Services from EMC for&#13;
Software are available for separate purchase and the Support Options are&#13;
identified at the Product Notice.&#13;
B.  Warranty Duration.  Unless otherwise stated on the EMC quote, the warranty&#13;
period for Software shall (i) be as set forth at the Product Notice; and (ii)&#13;
commence upon Delivery of the media or the date Customer is notified of&#13;
electronic availability, as applicable.&#13;
C.  Customer Remedies.  EMC's entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedies&#13;
under the warranties described in this section shall be for EMC, at its option,&#13;
to remedy the non-compliance or to replace the affected Software. If EMC is&#13;
unable to effect such within a reasonable time, then EMC shall refund the amount&#13;
received by EMC for the Software concerned. All replaced Software contained on&#13;
physical media supplied by EMC shall be returned to and become the property of&#13;
EMC. EMC shall have no liability hereunder after expiration of the applicable&#13;
warranty period. The foregoing shall not void any supplementary remedies made&#13;
available to Customer by a Distributor, with respect to which EMC shall have no&#13;
liability or obligation.&#13;
D.  Warranty Exclusions.  Warranty does not cover problems that arise from (i)&#13;
accident or neglect by Customer or any third party; (ii) any third party items&#13;
or services with which Software is used or other causes beyond EMC's control;&#13;
(iii) installation, operation or use not in accordance with EMC's instructions&#13;
or the applicable Documentation; (iv) use in an environment, in a manner or for&#13;
a purpose for which Software was not designed; or (v) modification, alteration&#13;
or repair by anyone other than EMC or its authorized representatives;. EMC has&#13;
no obligation whatsoever for Software installed or used beyond the licensed use,&#13;
or whose original identification marks have been altered or removed. Removal or&#13;
disablement of remote support capabilities during the warranty period requires&#13;
reasonable notice to EMC. Such removal or disablement, or improper use or&#13;
failure to use applicable Customer Support Tools shall be subject to a surcharge&#13;
in accordance with EMC's then current standard rates.&#13;
E.  No Further Warranties.  Except for the warranty set forth herein, and to the&#13;
maximum extent permitted by law, EMC (INCLUDING ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKES NO OTHER&#13;
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL. INSOFAR AS PERMITTED UNDER&#13;
APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED, INCLUDING&#13;
WARRANTIES ARISING BY STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.&#13;
&#13;
5.  SUPPORT SERVICES.&#13;
A.  Support Services.  If Customer has purchased Support Services for Software&#13;
(or its related hardware, if any) directly from EMC, such shall be delivered by&#13;
EMC as specified in the applicable Product Notice. If Customer has purchased&#13;
maintenance and support from a Distributor, then EMC may provide Support&#13;
Services to the extent that the Distributor has contracted with EMC to provide&#13;
Customer with Support Services.&#13;
B.  Reinstatement of Lapsed Support.  If Support Services expire or are&#13;
terminated, and Customer subsequently seeks to reinstate Support Services,&#13;
Customer shall pay: (i) the cumulative Support Services fees applicable for the&#13;
period during which Support Services lapsed; (ii) the annual support fees for&#13;
the then-current current period; and (iii) the then-current reinstatement fee&#13;
and/or certification fees, as quoted by EMC or a Distributor.&#13;
C.  Support Tools.  EMC may use Support Tools or may make certain Support Tools&#13;
available to assist Customer in performing various maintenance or support&#13;
related tasks. Customer shall use Support Tools only in accordance with the&#13;
terms under which EMC makes such available.&#13;
D.  Additional Support Terms.  Unless otherwise indicated in the Product Notice,&#13;
Support Services provided by EMC shall consist of (i) using commercially&#13;
reasonable efforts to remedy failures of Software to perform substantially in&#13;
accordance with EMC's applicable Documentation; (ii) providing English-language&#13;
(or where available, local language help line service (via telephone or other&#13;
electronic media); and (iii) providing, or enabling Customer to download&#13;
Software Releases and Documentation updates made generally available by EMC at&#13;
no additional charge to other purchasers of Support Service for the applicable&#13;
Software.&#13;
E.  Software Releases.  Upon use of a Software Release, Customer shall remove&#13;
and make no further use of all prior Software Releases, and protect such prior&#13;
Software Releases from disclosure or use by any third party. Customer is&#13;
authorized to retain a copy of each Software Release properly obtained by&#13;
Customer for Customer's archive purposes and use such as a temporary back-up if&#13;
the current Software Release becomes inoperable. Customer shall use and deploy&#13;
Software Releases strictly in accordance with terms of the original license for&#13;
the Software.&#13;
F.  Support Services for Software affected by Change in Hardware Status.  For&#13;
Software used on or operated in connection with hardware that ceases to be&#13;
covered by Support Services or the EMC hardware warranty, EMC reserves the right&#13;
to send Customer written notice that EMC has either chosen to discontinue or&#13;
change the price for Support Services for such Software (with such price change&#13;
effective as of the date the applicable EMC hardware ceases to be so covered).&#13;
If EMC sends a discontinuation notice, or if Customer rejects or does not&#13;
respond to the notice of a proposed price change within thirty (30) days after&#13;
receipt, Customer will be deemed to have terminated the Support Services for its&#13;
convenience.&#13;
G.  Support Services Exclusions.  Support Services do not cover problems that&#13;
arise from (i) accident or neglect by Customer or any third party; (ii) any&#13;
third party items or services with which the Software is used or other causes&#13;
beyond EMC's control; (iii) installation, operation or use not in accordance&#13;
with EMC's instructions or the applicable Documentation; (iv) use in an&#13;
environment, in a manner or for a purpose for which the Software or its related&#13;
hardware was not designed; or (v) modification, alteration or repair by anyone&#13;
other than EMC or its authorized designees. EMC has no obligation whatsoever for&#13;
Software installed or used beyond the licensed use. Removal or disablement of&#13;
Software's remote support capabilities during the term of Support Services&#13;
requires reasonable notice to EMC. Customer's removal, disablement of remote&#13;
support capabilities, or improper use of or failure to use Support Tools made&#13;
available to Customer shall subject Customer to a surcharge in accordance with&#13;
EMC's then current standard rates.&#13;
&#13;
6.  INDEMNITY.  EMC shall (i) defend Customer against any third party claim that&#13;
Software or Support Services infringes a patent or copyright existing in the&#13;
country in which EMC is located, the United States of America or the European&#13;
Union; and (ii) pay the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against&#13;
Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction or the amounts stated in a written&#13;
settlement negotiated by EMC. The foregoing obligations are subject to the&#13;
following: Customer (a) notifies EMC promptly in writing of such claim; (b)&#13;
grants EMC sole control over the defense and settlement thereof; (c) reasonably&#13;
cooperates in response to an EMC request for assistance; and (d) is not in&#13;
material breach of this Agreement. Should any such Software or Support Service&#13;
become, or in EMC's opinion be likely to become, the subject of such a claim,&#13;
EMC may, at its option and expense, (1) procure for Customer the right to make&#13;
continued use thereof; (2) replace or modify such so that it becomes non-&#13;
infringing; (3) request return of the Software and, upon receipt thereof; refund&#13;
the price paid by Customer, less straight-line depreciation based on a three (3)&#13;
year useful life for Software; or (4) discontinue the Support Service and refund&#13;
the portion of any pre-paid Support Service fee that corresponds to the period&#13;
of Support Service discontinuation. EMC shall have no liability to the extent&#13;
that the alleged infringement arises out of or relates to: (A) the use or&#13;
combination of Software or Support Service with third party products or&#13;
services; (B) use for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software or Support&#13;
Service was not designed; (C) any modification made by any person other than EMC&#13;
or its authorized representatives; (D) any modifications to Software or Support&#13;
Service made by EMC pursuant to Customer's specific instructions; (E) any&#13;
technology owned or licensed by Customer from third parties; or (F) use of any&#13;
older version of the Software when use of a newer Software Release made&#13;
available to Customer would have avoided the infringement. THIS SECTION STATES&#13;
CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND EMC'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR THIRD PARTY&#13;
INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.&#13;
&#13;
7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#13;
A.  Limitation on Direct Damages.  EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS ARISING UNDER&#13;
SECTION 6 ABOVE, EMC'S TOTAL LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY&#13;
FOR ANY CLAIM OF ANY TYPE WHATSOEVER, ARISING OUT OF SOFTWARE OR SERVICE&#13;
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, SHALL BE LIMITED TO PROVEN DIRECT DAMAGES CAUSED BY EMC'S&#13;
SOLE NEGLIGENCE IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED (i) US$1,000,000, FOR DAMAGE TO REAL&#13;
OR TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY; AND (ii) THE PRICE PAID BY CUSTOMER TO EMC FOR&#13;
THE SPECIFIC SERVICE (CALCULATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, WHEN APPLICABLE) OR&#13;
SOFTWARE FROM WHICH SUCH CLAIM ARISES, FOR DAMAGE OF ANY TYPE NOT IDENTIFIED IN&#13;
(i) ABOVE OR OTHERWISE EXCLUDED HEREUNDER.&#13;
B.  No Indirect Damages.  EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS REGARDING VIOLATION OF&#13;
EMC'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR CLAIMS ARISING UNDER SECTION 6 ABOVE,&#13;
NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR EMC SHALL HAVE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL,&#13;
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT&#13;
LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, DATA AND/OR USE), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#13;
POSSIBILITY THEREOF.&#13;
C.  Special Exclusion.  IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR&#13;
EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ALL OR A PORTION OF SECTION&#13;
7.A AND/OR 7.B ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY.&#13;
D.  Regular Back-ups.  As part of its obligation to mitigate damages, Customer&#13;
shall take reasonable data back-up measures. In particular, Customer shall back-&#13;
up the relevant data before EMC performs any remedial, upgrade, new Software&#13;
Release or other works on Customer's production systems. To the extent EMC's&#13;
liability for loss of data is not anyway excluded under this Agreement, EMC&#13;
shall in case of data losses only be liable for the typical effort to recover&#13;
the data which would have accrued if Customer had appropriately backed up its&#13;
data.&#13;
E.  Limitation Period.  Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the&#13;
limitation period for claims for damages shall be eighteen (18) months after the&#13;
cause of action accrues, unless statutory law provides for a shorter limitation&#13;
period.&#13;
F.  Suppliers.  The foregoing limitations shall also apply in favor of EMC's&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
8.  EVALUATION AND LOANED SOFTWARE.&#13;
A.  This Agreement shall also apply to (i) "Evaluation Software" (meaning the&#13;
copy of Software which contains this Agreement, including any copies made by or&#13;
on behalf of Customer, and all Documentation for the foregoing, which are&#13;
licensed for a limited duration for the specific purpose of evaluation prior to&#13;
making a final decision on procurement; and (ii) "Loaned Software" (meaning the&#13;
copy of Software which contains this Agreement, including any copies made by or&#13;
on behalf of Customer, and all Documentation for the foregoing, which are&#13;
licensed for a limited duration directly  to Customer for a limited period of&#13;
time at no charge), subject to the following:&#13;
B.  The particular Evaluation or Loaned Software, period of use, Installation&#13;
Site and other transaction-specific conditions shall be as mutually agreed&#13;
between EMC and Customer and recorded in the form of an evaluation or loan&#13;
schedule.&#13;
C.  Notwithstanding any deviating terms in this Agreement, all licenses for&#13;
Evaluation and Loaned Software expire at the end of the evaluation or loan&#13;
period.&#13;
D.  Customer shall return Evaluation and Loaned Software at the end of the&#13;
evaluation or loan period or when sooner terminated by EMC for convenience by&#13;
giving thirty (30) days' written notice, whichever occurs first. Customer shall&#13;
bear the risk of loss and damage for return of physical media, if any, and de-&#13;
installation.&#13;
E.  Customer may use Evaluation and Loaned Software free of charge, but, in the&#13;
case of Evaluation Software, solely for the purpose of evaluation and not in a&#13;
production environment.&#13;
F.  Without prejudice to any other limitations on EMC's liability set forth in&#13;
this Agreement (which shall also apply to Evaluation and Loaned Software),&#13;
Evaluation and Loaned Software are provided "AS IS" and any warranty or damage&#13;
claims against EMC in connection with Evaluation and Loaned Software are hereby&#13;
excluded, except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct of EMC.&#13;
G.  Unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by EMC, EMC does not provide&#13;
maintenance or support for any Evaluation Software. CUSTOMER RECOGNIZES THAT&#13;
EVALUATION SOFTWARE MAY HAVE DEFECTS OR DEFICIENCIES WHICH CANNOT OR MAY NOT BE&#13;
CORRECTED BY EMC. EMC shall have no liability to Customer for any action (or any&#13;
prior related claims) brought by or against Customer alleging that Customer's&#13;
sale, use or other disposition of any Evaluation Software infringes any patent,&#13;
copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right. In event of such&#13;
an action, EMC retains the right to terminate this Agreement and take possession&#13;
of the Evaluation Software. THIS SECTION STATES EMC'S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH&#13;
RESPECT TO ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY EVALUATION&#13;
SOFTWARE OR ANY PART OF IT OR ITS OPERATION.&#13;
&#13;
9.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each party shall (i) use Confidential Information of the&#13;
other party only for the purposes of exercising rights or performing obligations&#13;
in connection with this Agreement; and (ii) use at least reasonable care to&#13;
protect from disclosure to any third parties any Confidential Information&#13;
disclosed by the other party for a period commencing upon the date of disclosure&#13;
until three (3) years thereafter, except with respect to Customer data to which&#13;
EMC may have access in connection with the provision of Services, which shall&#13;
remain Confidential Information until one of the exceptions stated in the above&#13;
definition of Confidential Information applies. Notwithstanding the foregoing,&#13;
either party may disclose Confidential Information (a) to an Affiliate for the&#13;
purpose of fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights hereunder as long&#13;
as such Affiliate complies with the foregoing; and (b) if required by law&#13;
provided the receiving party has given the disclosing party prompt notice.&#13;
&#13;
10.  GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND EXPORT CONTROL.  Software and the technology&#13;
included therein provided under this Agreement are subject to governmental&#13;
restrictions on (i) exports from the U.S.; (ii) exports from other countries in&#13;

derivative products thereof; and (v) the importation and/or use of such Software&#13;
and technology included therein outside of the United States or other countries&#13;
(collectively, "Export Laws"). Customer shall comply with all Export Laws and&#13;
EMC export policies to the extent such policies are made available to Customer&#13;
by EMC. Diversion contrary to U.S. law or other Export Laws is expressly&#13;
prohibited.&#13;
&#13;
11.  TERMINATION.  Customer may terminate this Agreement for its convenience&#13;
upon thirty (30) days' notice to EMC. Either Customer or EMC may terminate this&#13;
Agreement upon written notice due to the other party's material breach of the&#13;
terms governing use of the Software; provided that such breach is not cured&#13;
within thirty (30) days after the provision of written notice to the breaching&#13;
party specifying the nature of such breach. Upon termination of this Agreement,&#13;
Customer shall cease all use and return or certify destruction of the applicable&#13;
Software (including copies) to EMC. Any provision that by its nature or context&#13;
is intended to survive any termination or expiration, including but not limited&#13;
to provisions relating to payment of outstanding fees, confidentiality and&#13;
liability, shall so survive.&#13;
&#13;
12.  MISCELLANEOUS.&#13;

C.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (i) is the complete statement of the&#13;
agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof; and (ii) may&#13;
be modified only by a writing signed by both parties. All terms of any purchase&#13;
order or similar document provided by Customer, including but not limited to any&#13;
pre-printed terms thereon and any terms that are inconsistent or conflict with&#13;
this Agreement, shall be null and void and of no legal force or effect.&#13;
D.  Force Majeure.  Except for the payment of fees, if any, due EMC from&#13;
Customer, neither party shall be liable under this Agreement because of a&#13;
failure or delay in performing its obligations hereunder on account of any force&#13;

jurisdiction of the courts of competency in the location where EMC is domiciled.&#13;
G.  Waiver.  No waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any prior or subsequent&#13;
default hereunder. If any part of this Agreement is held unenforceable, the&#13;
validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.&#13;
H.  Partial Invalidity.  If any part of this Agreement, a purchase order or an&#13;
