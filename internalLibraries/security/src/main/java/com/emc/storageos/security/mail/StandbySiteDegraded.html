
<p>Your Standby site ${siteName} has been degraded by Active site at ${degradeTime}. This could be caused by following reasons (including but not limited to):<br>

    <br>1) Network connection between Standby site and Active site was lost;
    <br>2) Majority of nodes in Standby site are done.
    <br>3) Active or Standby site has experienced an outage or majority of nodes and not all nodes came back online (its controller status is "Degraded").
    
<p>Please verify network connectivity between Active site and Standby Site(s), make sure Active and Standby Site's controller status is "STABLE".

<p>NOTE: If Active site or Standby site temporarily experienced and outage of majority of nodes, the Standby site can only return to synchronized state with Active when 
ALL nodes of Active and Standby site(s) are back and their controller status is "STABLE".

<p>Thank you,<br>ViPR
