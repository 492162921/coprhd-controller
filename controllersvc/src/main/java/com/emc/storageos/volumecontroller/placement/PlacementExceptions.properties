pathsLTNetworks=The num_paths parameter {0} is less than the number of networks {1} so cannot allocate a port for all initiators
cannotAllocateRequestedPorts=Unable to allocate the requested number of ports for Initiator Network {0} storage system {1}, {2} requested, {3} allocated, {4} total ports available
noStoragePortsInNetwork=There are no available storage ports in the Network {0} requested to be used for export. This may be because they are all over an allocation ceiling.
cannotAllocateMinPaths=Cannot allocate requested min_path number of ports; ports needed {0}, initiator count {1}, paths_per_initiator {2}, min_paths {3}, max_paths {4}; there may be too few initiators to provide the requested minimum number of paths
hostHasFewerThanMinPaths=Host {0} {1} has fewer ports assigned {2} than min_paths {3}; there may be too few initiators on this host to provide the requested number of paths
hostHasUnusedInitiators=Host {0} {1} has some initiators that were not assigned storage ports, but the export type is Exclusive; max_paths may be too small or paths_per_initiator may be too high
insufficientRedundancy=Too few Storage Port HA Domains {1} for maxPaths {0}, which caused the StoragePortsAllocator to be unable to allocate redundant ports; please make sure ports from different HA domains (e.g. directors) are in each network in your virtual array
